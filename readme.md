*Still under dev*

Visualize :

- Audio Files (.mp3)
- Algorithms
- Graphs
- Wave functions

And more

Cool stuff I'd want to visualize:
- [Conoway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
- [MandelBrot sets stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)

Tech used : Opengl

### How to run
This is how I intend to run the application,  none of this has been implemented yet !
`vision data.mp3`
`vision data.csv`

### How build

 - Generate project files using premake
Run the premake script
`premake5 vs2017` for windows or `premake5 gmake2`

The solution/make files will be in the `workspace` directory.
